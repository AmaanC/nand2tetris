##About

I'm using this repository to store the code I work on for [the nand2tetris course](http://nand2tetris.org/). The objective is to build a computer which can run games like tetris with the starting block of a NAND gate. We'll build everything in between.

The folders in this repo come from the [zip file found here](http://nand2tetris.org/software.php). The projects folder in the zip file, specifically.
